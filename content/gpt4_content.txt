We are trying to lead the way with a campaign to entice young people from all walks of life and all levels of education into the world of market data.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 "Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Irelandö (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).\n\nIn our opinion the financial statements:\n- give a true and fair view of the state of the companyÆs affairs as at 28 February 2022 and of its profit for the year then ended;\n- have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and\n- have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nBasis for opinion\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the AuditorÆs responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the\n```plaintext\nREPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS TO THE MEMBERS OF\nCROWN JEWELS CONSULTANTS LTD\n\nMatters on which we are required to report by exception\nIn the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not \nidentified material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Report of the Directors.\n\nWe have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our \nopinion:\n- adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited \nby us; or\n- the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or\n- certain disclosures of directors\' remuneration specified by law are not made; or\n- we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.\n\nResponsibilities of directors\nAs explained more fully in the Statement of DirectorsÆ Responsibilities set out on page four, the directors are responsible for the \npreparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the \ndirectors determine necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due \nto fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the companyÆs ability to continue as a going concern, \ndisclosing, as\nREPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS TO THE MEMBERS OF\nCROWN JEWELS CONSULTANTS LTD\n\nAuditors\' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as whole are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor\'s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they should reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions if users taken on the basis of the financial statements.\n\nOur approach to identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations, was as follows:\n\n- the engagement partner ensured that the engagement team collectively had the appropriate competence, capabilities and skills to identify or recognise non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations;\n- we identified the laws and regulations applicable to the company through discussions with directors and other management, and from our commercial knowledge and experience of the software consultancy sector;\n- we focused on specific laws and regulations which we considered may have a direct material effect on the financial statements or the operations of the company, including the Companies Act 2006, taxation legislation and data protection, anti-bribery, and employment\n```\nREPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS TO THE MEMBERS OF\nCROWN JEWELS CONSULTANTS LTD\n\nUse of our report\nThis report is made solely to the company\'s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. \nOur audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company\'s members those matters we are required to state to them \nin a Report of the Auditors and for no other purpose.

STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 "The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland" and the Companies Act 2006.\n\n3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nBasis of preparing the financial statements\nThe financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the modification to a fair value basis for certain financial instruments as specified in the accounting policies below.\n\nThe principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.\n\nThe company\'s subsidiary ceased trading in 2020 and was struck off on 18 May 2021. The company is no longer a parent company and is not required under Financial Reporting Standard 102 to prepare consolidated accounts.\n\nSignificant judgements and estimates\nThe preparation of the financial statements requires management to make significant judgements and estimates.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued\n\nTangible fixed assets\nTangible fixed assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.\n\nDepreciation is calculated to write down the cost less estimated residual value of all tangible fixed assets over their expected useful lives, using the straight-line method.\n\nThe rates applicable are:\n\n- Plant and machinery 4 years\n- Fixtures and fittings 5 years\n- Computer equipment 4 years\n\nImpairment of Assets\nAt each reporting date, fixed assets are reviewed to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If there is an indication of possible impairment, the recoverable amount of any affected asset is estimated and compared with its carrying amount. If estimated recoverable amount is lower, the carrying amount is reduced to its estimated recoverable amount.\n\nIf an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but not in excess of the amount that would have been determined had no impairment been recognised for the asset in prior years.\n\nAll impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses are recognised immediately in profit or loss.\n\nGovernment grants\nGrants are accounted for under the accruals model as permitted by FRS102.\n\n\nCROWN JEWELS CONSULTANTS LTD (REGISTERED NUMBER: 03899913)\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - continued\n\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 28 FEBRUARY 2022\n\n3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued\n\nResearch and development\n\nExpenditure on research and development is written off in the year in which it is incurred.\n\nForeign currency translation of transactions and balances\n\nTransactions in currencies other than the functional currency are recognised at the date of the transaction. At the end of each month, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.\n\nExchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise.\n\nLeased assets\n\nLeases which do not transfer substantially all risks and rewards of ownership to the company are classified as operating leases. Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nIn the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability. The aggregate benefit of incentives are recognised as a reduction of rental expenses on a straight-line basis, except where another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased assets are consumed.\n\nGoing Concern\n\nAfter reviewing the company\'s management accounts to the date of the signing of these accounts and the company\'s forecasts and projections, the directors\nSure, here\'s the extracted text:\n\n---\n\nCROWN JEWELS CONSULTANTS LTD (REGISTERED NUMBER: 03899913)\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - continued\n\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 28 FEBRUARY 2022\n\n3.

Other financial liabilities, including loans, are measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\nLong term creditors are identified and classified separately from short term creditors only where the company has an unconditional right at the end of the accounting period to defer settlement of the creditor for at least one year.\n\nProvisions for Liabilities\nProvisions are recognised when the company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the company will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\n\nThe amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.\n\nEmployee Benefits\nThe company has provided for annual leave accrued by employees as a result of services rendered in the current period, and which employees are entitled to carry forward and use within the next twelve months. The provision is measured at the salary cost payable for the period of absence.\n\nThe\nCROWN JEWELS CONSULTANTS LTD (REGISTERED NUMBER: 03899913)\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - continued  \nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 28 FEBRUARY 2022\n\n5.
