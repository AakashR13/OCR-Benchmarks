Our long term relationship with London Stock Exchange Group enters its final year of the latest three year term, with both parties keen to get around the table and lay down the principles and mechanisms to continue the partnership for another long term.\nOur Commercial Management arm of the company is now under new management, and the business plan that has been presented to the board shows a projected growth and most importantly a bigger gross margin.\nCrown Jewels is paying particular attention this year to encouraging new blood into the industry. We are trying to lead the way with a campaign to entice young people from all walks of life and all levels of education into the world of market data. We are trying to open the magic box that is market data by giving a clear and concise message of what it is in all its parts. This will all form part of "The Crown Jewels Academy/Apprenticeship Scheme"\nREVIEW OF BUSINESS\nCompany turnover increased by 1.0% and the gross profit percentage increased by 7.3% from 38.5% to 45.8%, principally due to reduced costs.\nThe company\'s net profit before tax, ignoring one-off items such as government grants, dividends received from its subsidiary and profit on winding up of its subsidiary, increased by 187.9% in the year with lower overall costs.\nThe company is maintaining a healthy balance sheet with excellent liquidity and net assets up by 15.4%.\nPRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES Market risk\nOur business continues to add value for our clients and is still seeing increased demand for our services delivered from our global branches. The directors are now very happy that the company\'s product offering, especially with the cloud element, is assisting the growth of the company and is enabling us to be true leaders in our industry.\nThe company\'s potential risk is a lot lower now the world has returned to normal operations following the pandemic. Staff are now returning to the office and we have created a happy medium of office and home days, reinforcing what we said last year about the hybrid working model.\nTo our clients nothing changed; our services still meet or exceed the measured KPIs and we don\'t see that changing.\nFluctuation of currency exchange rates may have an adverse effect on our foreign exchange exposure, but in the long run it seems to balance itself out. The accounting department are very diligent on monitoring the movement of exchange rates and the use of currency hedging strategies, with approval of the board.\nTreasury operations and financial instruments\nThe company\'s principal financial instruments include financial assets and liabilities such as trade debtors and trade creditors arising directly from operations.\nLiquidity risk\nThe company manages its cash in order to ensure that at any point the company has sufficient liquid resources to meet the operating needs of the business. The company has improved its strong balance sheet and bank reserves.\nForeign exchange risk\nThe company transacts in foreign currencies which enhances the risk of significant gains and losses arising in currency fluctuations. The directors monitor movements in foreign currencies and consider options to minimise this risk. Cashflow movements between accounts denominated in different currencies are timed to minimise any exchange losses.\nPage 2\nCROWN JEWELS CONSULTANTS LTD (REGISTERED NUMBER: 03899913)\nSTRATEGIC REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 28 FEBRUARY 2022\nIMPORTANT EVENTS AFTER THE YEAR END\nWe continue to support the scheme we are putting in place to bring new blood into the market data arena.\nWe are working to secure the renewal of the contract with our major client for the next 3 years.\nThe board is giving full support to the new business plans from the Commercial Management arm and will be checking that the stated targets are being reached.\nThe company is securing the foothold we have with the major cloud providers and to lead the technology space which the company is in.\nON BEHALF OF THE BOARD:\nMr P R Gow - Director\n22 November 2022\nPage 3\nCROWN JEWELS CONSULTANTS LTD (REGISTERED NUMBER: 03899913)\nREPORT OF THE DIRECTORS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 28 FEBRUARY 2022\nThe directors present their report with the financial statements of the company for the year ended 28 February 2022.\nPRINCIPAL ACTIVITY\nThe principal activity of the company in the year under review was that of software consultancy and supply.\nDIVIDENDS\nThe total distribution of dividends for the year ended 28 February 2022 was ú250,862 (2021: ú398,816). Further dividends of ú180,408 have been paid after the year end.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nThe company is incurring non-qualifying research and development costs developing a product to complement its services.\nFUTURE DEVELOPMENTS Future developments are included in the Strategic Report.\nEVENTS SINCE THE END OF THE YEAR\nInformation relating to events since the end of the year is given in the notes to the financial statements.\nDIRECTORS\nThe directors shown below have held office during the whole of the period from 1 March 2021 to the date of this report.\nMr P R Gow\nMr K J Covington\nOther changes in directors holding office are as follows:\nMr P R P Tomblin - resigned 28 April 2021 Mr T L Kozlowski - resigned 26 January 2022\nDISCLOSURE IN THE STRATEGIC REPORT\nAs permitted by s414c(11) of the Companies Act 2006, the directors have elected to disclose information, required to be in the directors\' report by Schedule 7 of the "Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008", in the strategic report.\nSTATEMENT OF DIRECTORS\' RESPONSIBILITIES\nThe directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, the Report of the Directors and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.\nCompany law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law), including Financial Reporting Standard 102 \'The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland\'. Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or loss of the company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:\n- select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;\n- make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;\n- prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue in business.\nThe directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the company\'s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.\nPage 4\nCROWN JEWELS CONSULTANTS LTD (REGISTERED NUMBER: 03899913)\nREPORT OF THE DIRECTORS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 28 FEBRUARY 2022\nSTATEMENT AS TO DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO AUDITORS\nEach of the persons who are directors at the time when this directors\' report is approved has confirmed that:\n- so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the company\'s auditor is unaware, and\n- the director has taken all the steps that ought to have been taken as a director in order to be aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the company\'s auditor is aware of that information.\nAUDITORS The auditors, Blick Rothenberg Audit LLP, will be proposed for re-appointment.\nON BEHALF OF THE BOARD:\nMr P R Gow - Director\n22 November 2022\nPage 5\nREPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS TO THE MEMBERS OF CROWN JEWELS CONSULTANTS LTD\nOpinion\nWe have audited the financial statements of Crown Jewels Consultants Ltd (the "company") for the year ended 28 February 2022 which comprise the Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Statement of Financial Position, the Statement of Changes in Equity, the Statement of Cash Flows, Notes to the Statement of Cash Flows, and the Notes to the Financial Statements, including a summary of significant accounting polices. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 "Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland" (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).\nIn our opinion the financial statements:\n- give a true and fair view of the state of the company\'s affairs as at 28 February 2022 and of its profit for the year then ended;\n- have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and\n- have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\nBasis for opinion\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors\' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting Council\'s Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\nConclusions relating to going concern\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors\' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company\'s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.\nOther information\nThe other information comprises the information included in the annual report other than the financial statements and our auditor\'s report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\nOpinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:\n- the information given in the Strategic Report and the Report of the Directors for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and\n- the Strategic Report and the Report of the Directors have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.\nPage 6\nREPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS TO THE MEMBERS OF CROWN JEWELS CONSULTANTS LTD\nMatters on which we are required to report by exception\nIn the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Report of the Directors.\nWe have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:\n- adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\n- the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or\n- certain disclosures of directors\' remuneration specified by law are not made; or\n- we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.\nResponsibilities of directors\nAs explained more fully in the Statement of Directors\' Responsibilities set out on page four, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company\'s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\nPage 7\nREPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS TO THE MEMBERS OF CROWN JEWELS CONSULTANTS LTD\nAuditors\' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as whole are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor\'s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they should reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions if users taken on the basis of the financial statements.\nOur approach to identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations, was as follows:\n- the engagement partner ensured that the engagement team collectively had the appropriate competence, capabilities and skills to identify or recognise non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations;\n- we identified the laws and regulations applicable to the company through discussions with directors and other management, and from our commercial knowledge and experience of the software consultancy sector;\n- we focused on specific laws and regulations which we considered may have a direct material effect on the financial statements or the operations of the company, including the Companies Act 2006, taxation legislation and data protection, anti-bribery, and employment legislation;\n- we assessed the extent of compliance with the laws and regulations identified above through making enquiries of management and inspecting legal correspondence; and\n- identified laws and regulations were communicated within the audit team regularly and the team remained alert to instances of non-compliance throughout the audit.\nWe assessed the susceptibility of the company\'s financial statements to material misstatement, including obtaining an understanding of how fraud might occur, by:\n- making enquiries of management as to where they considered there was susceptibility to fraud, their knowledge of actual, suspected and alleged fraud; and\n- considering the internal controls in place to mitigate risks of fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations.\nTo address the risk of fraud through management bias and override of controls, we:\n- performed analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships;\n- tested a sample of journal entries to identify unusual transactions;\n- assessed whether judgements and assumptions made in determining the accounting estimates were indicative of potential bias; and\n- investigated the rationale behind significant or unusual transactions.\nIn response to the risk of irregularities and non-compliance with laws and regulations, we designed procedures which included, but were not limited to:\n- agreeing financial statement disclosures to underlying supporting documentation;\n- enquiring of management as to actual and potential litigation and claims; and\n- reviewing correspondence with HMRC.\nThere are inherent limitations in our audit procedures described above. The more removed that laws and regulations are from financial transactions, the less likely it is that we would become aware of non-compliance. Auditing standards also limit the audit procedures required to identify non-compliance with laws and regulations to enquiry of the directors and other management and the inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any.\nMaterial misstatements that arise due to fraud can be harder to detect than those that arise from error as they may involve deliberate concealment or collusion.\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council\'s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of the auditor\'s report.\nPage 8\nREPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS TO THE MEMBERS OF CROWN JEWELS CONSULTANTS LTD\nUse of our report\nThis report is made solely to the company\'s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company\'s members those matters we are required to state to them in a Report of the Auditors and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company\'s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\nMarc Levy FCA (Senior Statutory Auditor) for and on behalf of Blick Rothenberg Audit LLP Chartered Accountants Statutory Auditor 16 Great Queen Street Covent Garden London WC2B 5AH\n22 November 2022\nPage 9\nCROWN JEWELS CONSULTANTS LTD (REGISTERED NUMBER: 03899913)\nSTATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME FOR THE YEAR ENDED 28 FEBRUARY 2022\nNotes\n2022\n2021\nú ú\nú\nú\nREVENUE\n4\n14,269,245\n14,133,195\nCost of sales\n7,739,014\n8,692,776\nGROSS PROFIT\n6,530,231\n5,440,419\nAdministrative expenses\n4,594,228\n4,816,475\n1,936,003\n623,944\nOther operating income\n5\n19,145\n194,724\nOPERATING PROFIT\n7\n1,955,148\n818,668\nIncome from shares in group undertakings\n180,467\nInterest receivable and similar income\n12,841\n12,841\n180,467\n1,967,989\n999,135\nAmounts written off investments\n8\n140,346\n1,967,989\n858,789\nInterest payable and similar expenses\n9\n8,674\nPROFIT BEFORE TAXATION\n1,959,315\n858,789\nTax on profit\n10\n409,699\n93,047\nPROFIT FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR\n1,549,616\n765,742\nOTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nTOTAL COMPREHENSIVE INCOME FOR THE YEAR\n1,549,616\n765,742\nThe notes form part of these financial statements\nPage 10\nCROWN JEWELS CONSULTANTS LTD (REGISTERED NUMBER: 03899913)\nSTATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION 28 FEBRUARY 2022\nNotes\n2022\n2021\nú\nú\nú\nú\nFIXED ASSETS\nProperty, plant and equipment\n12\n183,424\n87,259\nInvestments\n13\n150\n183,424\n87,409\nCURRENT ASSETS\nDebtors\n14\n2,794,786\n2,698,894\nPrepayments and accrued income\n247,210\n270,327\nCash at bank\n3,600,591\n2,654,639\n6,642,587\n5,623,860\nCREDITORS\nAmounts falling due within one year\n15\n3,511,369\n3,047,806\nNET CURRENT ASSETS\n3,131,218\n2,576,054\nTOTAL ASSETS LESS CURRENT LIABILITIES\n3,314,642\n2,663,463\nCREDITORS\nAmounts falling due after more than one\n(224,643)\nyear\n16\nPROVISIONS FOR LIABILITIES\n20\n(16,811)\n1\nNET ASSETS\n3,073,188\n2,663,463\nCAPITAL AND RESERVES\nCalled up share capital\n21\n5,996\n7,048\nCapital redemption reserve\n22\n1,753\n701\nShare option reserve\n22\n61,141\n32,922\nRetained earnings\n22\n3,004,298\n2,622,792\nSHAREHOLDERS\' FUNDS\n3,073,188\n2,663,463\nThe financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors and authorised for issue on 22 November 2022 and were signed on its behalf by:\nMr P R Gow - Director\nThe notes form part of these financial statements\nPage 11 :unselected:\nCROWN JEWELS CONSULTANTS LTD (REGISTERED NUMBER: 03899913)\nSTATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY FOR THE YEAR ENDED 28 FEBRUARY 2022\nCalled up share capital\nRetained earnings\nCapital redemption reserve\nShare option reserve\nTotal equity\nú\nú\nú\nú\nBalance at 1 March 2020\n7,048\n2,255,866\n701\n4,703\n2,268,318\nChanges in equity\nDividends\n(398,816)\n-\n(398,816)\nTotal comprehensive income\n765,742\n1\n765,742\nShare based payment charge\n2,622,792\n28,219\n28,219\nBalance at 28 February 2021\n7,048\n701\n32,922\n2,663,463\nChanges in equity\nPurchase of own shares\n(1,052)\n(917,248)\n1,052\nI\n(917,248)\nDividends\n1\n(250,862)\n(250,862)\nTotal comprehensive income\n1\n1,549,616\n1\n28,219\n1,549,616\nShare based payment charge\n28,219\nBalance at 28 February 2022\n5,996\n3,004,298\n1,753\n61,141\n3,073,188\nThe notes form part of these financial statements\nPage 12\nCROWN JEWELS CONSULTANTS LTD (REGISTERED NUMBER: 03899913)\nSTATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 28 FEBRUARY 2022\nNotes\n2022\n2021\nú\nú\nCash flows from operating activities\nCash generated from operations\n1\n2,218,779\n721,565\nInterest paid\n(753)\nTax paid\n(196,127)\n(14,978)\nNet cash from operating activities\n2,021,899\n706,587\nCash flows from investing activities\nPurchase of tangible fixed assets\n(158,457)\n(49,225)\nSale of fixed asset investments\n150\nI\nInterest received\n120\nDividends received\n180,467\nNet cash from investing activities\n(158,187)\n131,242\nCash flows from financing activities\nNew loans in year\n250,000\n1\nShare buyback\n(917,248)\nShare capital paid up\n350\n1\nEquity dividends paid\n(250,862)\n(398,816)\nNet cash from financing activities\n(917,760)\n(398,816)\nIncrease in cash and cash equivalents\n945,952\n439,013\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of year\n2\n2,654,639\n2,215,626\nCash and cash equivalents at end of year\n2\n3,600,591\n2,654,639\nThe notes form part of these financial statements\nPage 13\nCROWN JEWELS CONSULTANTS LTD (REGISTERED NUMBER: 03899913)\nNOTES TO THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 28 FEBRUARY 2022\n1.

STATUTORY INFORMATION\nCrown Jewels Consultants Ltd is a private company, limited by shares, incorporated in England and Wales. The company\'s registered number and registered office address can be found on the Information page.\nThe presentation currency of the financial statements is GB Pound Sterling (ú), which is the company\'s functional currency.\n2. STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 "The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland" and the Companies Act 2006.\n3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of preparing the financial statements\nThe financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the modification to a fair value basis for certain financial instruments as specified in the accounting policies below.\nThe principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.\nThe company\'s subsidiary ceased trading in 2020 and was struck off on 18 May 2021. The company is no longer a parent company and is not required under Financial Reporting Standard 102 to prepare consolidated accounts.\nSignificant judgements and estimates\nThe preparation of the financial statements requires management to make significant judgements and estimates. The items in the financial statements where these judgement and estimates have been made include:\nJudgements\n- The method of allocating income and costs to the foreign branches. Income allocation is based on specific contracts/customers based in that jurisdiction and an allocation of income from global contracts based on payroll costs in the relevant branch. Costs are actual costs arising in the particular jurisdiction.\n- The vesting period to expected exercise of share options issued under the Enterprise Management Incentive scheme.\nEstimates\n- The useful life of fixed assets.\n-The share-based payment charge in the accounts relies on estimates of volatility of the share price and the number of employees remaining in employment with the company until exercise. Changes to these estimates would change the annual charge required.\nTurnover\nRevenue represents amounts receivable from the provision of consultancy services and application support, net of VAT and discounts.\nRevenue from services undertaken on a time basis is recognised when the services are undertaken. Where revenue relates to fixed price service contract, revenue is recognised ratably over the term of the contract.\nPage 15\ncontinued ...\nCROWN JEWELS CONSULTANTS LTD (REGISTERED NUMBER: 03899913)\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - continued FOR THE YEAR ENDED 28 FEBRUARY 2022\n3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued\nTangible fixed assets\nTangible fixed assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.\nDepreciation is calculated to write down the cost less estimated residual value of all tangible fixed assets over their expected useful lives, using the straight-line method.\nThe rates applicable are:\n- Plant and machinery 4 years\n- Fixtures and fittings 5 years\n- Computer equipment 4 years\nImpairment of Assets\nAt each reporting date, fixed assets are reviewed to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If there is an indication of possible impairment, the recoverable amount of any affected asset is estimated and compared with its carrying amount. If estimated recoverable amount is lower, the carrying amount is reduced to its estimated recoverable amount.\nIf an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but not in excess of the amount that would have been determined had no impairment been recognised for the asset in prior years.\nAll impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses are recognised immediately in profit or loss.\nGovernment grants\nGrants are accounted for under the accruals model as permitted by FRS102.\nGrants of a revenue nature are recognised in the profit and loss account in the same period as the related expenditure.\nInvestments in subsidiaries\nInvestments in subsidiary undertakings are recognised at cost less impairment.\nTaxation\nTaxation for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.\nCurrent or deferred taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.\nCurrent tax is recognised at the amount of tax payable using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the statement of financial position date.\nDeferred tax\nDeferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the statement of financial position date.\nTiming differences arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in financial statements. Deferred tax is measured using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the year end and that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.\nUnrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.\nPage 16\ncontinued ...\nCROWN JEWELS CONSULTANTS LTD (REGISTERED NUMBER: 03899913)\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - continued FOR THE YEAR ENDED 28 FEBRUARY 2022\n3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued\nResearch and development\nExpenditure on research and development is written off in the year in which it is incurred.\nForeign currency translation of transactions and balances\nTransactions in currencies other than the functional currency are recognised at the date of the transaction. At the end of each month, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.\nExchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise.\nLeased assets\nLeases which do not transfer substantially all risks and rewards of ownership to the company are classified as operating leases. Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nIn the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognized as a liability. The aggregate benefit of incentives are recognised as a reduction of rental expenses on a straight-line basis, except where another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased assets are consumed.\nGoing Concern\nAfter reviewing the company\'s management accounts to the date of the signing of these accounts and the company\'s forecasts and projections, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The majority of the company\'s revenue is generated from its contract with the London Stock Exchange Group, which is due for renewal in October 2023. Contract renewal negotiations are already at an advanced stage and the directors are confident that they will soon be successfully concluded. The directors also believe that the company is very well placed competitively due to its niche knowledge and expertise, which places the business in a strong position to grow its other existing sources of income. Potential opportunities to move into new geographical markets are also being explored and the company\'s financial position is currently very healthy with cash reserves of around ú2.6m. Notwithstanding that the directors are confident of its main contract being renewed, they also believe that the company has sufficient resources available to restructure and continue the business if this was not the case. The directors therefore continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these financial statements.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, demand deposits with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts. In the statement of financial position, bank overdrafts are shown within current liabilities.\nDebtors\nShort term debtors are measured at the undiscounted amount of cash or other consideration expected to be received, less any impairment. If the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, for example receipt is allowed to be deferred beyond normal commercial terms or financed at an interest rate other than at market rate, the asset is measured at the present value of the future payments discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar type of debt.\nPage 17\ncontinued ...\nCROWN JEWELS CONSULTANTS LTD (REGISTERED NUMBER: 03899913)\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - continued FOR THE YEAR ENDED 28 FEBRUARY 2022\n3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued\nCreditors\nShort term trade creditors are measured at the transaction price. Other financial liabilities, including loans, are measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\nLong term creditors are identified and classified separately from short term creditors only where the company has an unconditional right at the end of the accounting period to defer settlement of the creditor for at least one year.\nProvisions for Liabilities\nProvisions are recognised when the company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the company will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\nThe amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.\nEmployee Benefits\nThe company has provided for annual leave accrued by employees as a result of services rendered in the current period, and which employees are entitled to carry forward and use within the next twelve months. The provision is measured at the salary cost payable for the period of absence.\nThe costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense.\nTermination benefits are recognised immediately as an expense when the company is demonstrably committed to terminate the employment of an employee or to provide termination benefits.\nShare based payments\nThe company provides share-based payments to certain employees under an Enterprise Management Incentive scheme. Details are outlined in Note 27.\nThe total expected expense is based on the fair value of the options on the grant date, calculated using a valuation model, and is recognised on a straight line basis over the expected vesting period in the profit and loss account with a corresponding credit to equity.\n4.

A small profits rate will also be introduced for companies with profits of ú50,000 or less so that they will continue to pay corporation tax at 19% and companies with profits between ú50,000 and ú250,000 will pay tax at the main rate reduced by a marginal relief providing a gradual increase in the effective corporation tax rate. Deferred taxes at the balance sheet date have been measured using these enacted tax rates and reflected in these financial statements.\nDuring the year beginning 1 March 2022, the net reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities on the UK corporation tax for the year is not expected to be significant, due to foreign branch profits being taxed in their respective jurisdictions.\n2022\n2021\nú\nú\n"C" Ordinary non-voting share of ú1\nInterim div share type C\n22,500\n92,484\n"E" Ordinary non-voting shares of ú1 each\n22,500\n140,744\nInterim div share type E\n"G" Ordinary non-voting shares of ú1 each Interim div share type G\n205,862\n165,588\n250,862\n398,816\n11.

On exercise of the options by the employees, the company issues new shares. All 566 options granted remain outstanding at the year end.\nThe fair value of the share options granted during the year was determined using a model based on the Black-Scholes model which is considered to be the most appropriate generally accepted valuation method of measuring fair value.\nThe total charge this year is ú28,219 (2021: ú28,219).\nPage 27\nThis document was delivered using electronic communications and authenticated in accordance with the registrar\'s rules relating to electronic form, authentication and manner of delivery under section 1072 of the Companies Act 2006.
